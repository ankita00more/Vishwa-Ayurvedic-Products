<p>Ayurveda essentially means the knowledge of life. It is a precise combination of science and the art of healthy living. Ayurveda is popular for its extensive natural healing ways that work on illnesses and improving the general wellness of the human body and mind.

It does not simply mean chanting, yoga, applying packs and massaging with oils, but branches deep into the psychological and physiological aspects of eliminating the root cause of health problems.

Ayurveda is based on the principle that to achieve and maintain health over the course of your life, you must re-balancing emotions, improve diet, practice yoga and “pranayama” (breathing exercises), and make lifestyle adjustments.</p>

<p>
Every human is characterized by the mind-body type. In Ayurveda, these primary qualities that govern the body are called “doshas.”

Like traditional Chinese medicine, the five elements of nature – water, earth, fire, space, and air make up for a combination in the three primary doshas – vata, pitta, and kapha. When these doshas are perfectly balanced, the state of being is healthy. When they fall out of balance through dehydration, anxiety, stress, low energy or excessive exertion,the person is propelled into a state of “vikruti” – an imbalanced state of body and mind.

Ayurveda brings health and keeping the doshas in balance. Overall, it aims at holistically maintaining and improving general health no matter what age you are.
